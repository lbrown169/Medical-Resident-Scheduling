hey! i finished the frontend for the rotation form page but didnt have time to connect it to the backend. heres what needs to be done to get it fully working:

1. database table for pgy4_rotation_requests
   - needs fields for first_priority through eighth_priority
   - also alternative_1, alternative_2, avoid, and additional_notes
   - check out the other tables in the database for reference on structure

2. backend model file (backend/Models/PGY4RotationRequests.cs)
   - can use one of the existing model files as a template
   - make sure column names match what you setup in the databse table

3. update MedicalContext.cs
   - add the DbSet for PGY4RotationRequests
   - might need to add some config in OnModelCreating method

4. create API controller (backend/Controllers/PGY4RotationRequestsController.cs)
   - GET endpoint to fetch existing request for a resident
   - POST endpoint to create new request
   - PUT endpoint to update an existing request
   - the other controllers in that folder are good examples to work from

5. update the frontend (PGY3RotationForm.tsx)
   - currently just logs to console when you submit
   - needs to actually call the API endpoints
   - should fetch existing data on page load so residents can see their previous submission
   - other dashboard forms show how this is done

6. testing
   - login as a pgy3 resident (natalie.portman@example.com / password123)
   - fill out and submit the form
   - check database to confirm it saved
   - try submiting again to verify it prevents duplicates

the form currently only displays for residents with gradute_yr = 3 (pgy-3s)
submission deadline is december 12 2025 at 11:59pm
